Problem statement:

Pollution, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, is a growing threat to our planet. 
The World Bank estimates that global carbon emissions reached a record high of 36.3
billion tonnes in 2021. A significant portion of these emissions originates from the 
production, transportation, and use of various products. Consumers are increasingly 
seeking sustainable options to minimize their environmental impact, but lack of transparency 
makes informed decision-making difficult. Traditional carbon footprinting methodologies, while highly accurate, 
are often expensive and time-consuming, limiting their widespread adoption. Consequently, consumers often lack 
readily available information about a product's environmental impact at the point of purchase which hinders 
their ability to make informed choices.Developing a cost-effective solution to estimate product carbon
footprints is crucial to empower consumers and promote sustainable consumption practices.

Project Summary:
This project of empowering sustainable consumption through real-time product carbon footprinting stands as a beacon of hope in the fight against climate change. By equipping consumers with instant access to crucial environmental data, we have the potential to revolutionize purchasing habits and drive significant positive change throughout the marketplace. This initiative holds promise not only in promoting eco-conscious decision-making on an individual level but also in catalyzing broader shifts towards sustainability across industries and supply chains.
