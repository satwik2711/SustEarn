Problem statement:

Pollution, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, is a growing threat to our planet. 
The World Bank estimates that global carbon emissions reached a record high of 36.3
billion tonnes in 2021. A significant portion of these emissions originates from the 
production, transportation, and use of various products. Consumers are increasingly 
seeking sustainable options to minimize their environmental impact, but lack of transparency 
makes informed decision-making difficult. Traditional carbon footprinting methodologies, while highly accurate, 
are often expensive and time-consuming, limiting their widespread adoption. Consequently, consumers often lack 
readily available information about a product's environmental impact at the point of purchase which hinders 
their ability to make informed choices.Developing a cost-effective solution to estimate product carbon
footprints is crucial to empower consumers and promote sustainable consumption practices.
